<h2>About</h2>
<h3>Who Is The Lion?</h3>
<p>Aloysius Italus (literally meaning "Famous warrior of Italy) was born to a lower-class family of gladiators during the Roman Empire. His father, Lucius Italus, was also a gladiator. Lucius once hoped to climb the ranks of being a gladiator and be the most renowned fighter in all of the Roman Empire. But this dream was vanquished when he was killed in combat by the champion of Rome, Magnus Juventus. Before Lucius died, he taught Aloysius the basics of combat. Under the training of former champion Octavian Augustus, Aloysius learned to follow in his father's footsteps. At the age of 15, Aloysius stepped into the arena for the first time and was immediately overwhelmed by his opponent. After his defeat, Aloysius stopped going to the arena and trained hard for the next 4 years. When he became 19, Aloysius stepped into the arena once again. As his opponent came at him, Aloysius dodged and attacked. After his opponent backed up, Aloysius ran and jumped, sword slicing the air as he pounced upon his opponent. Aloysius had easily defeated him, and with this win, he continued onwards. After doing this technique several times on different occasions, it became his signature move. This also gained him the nickname of "The Lion," because his signature move is just how a lion pounces on their prey. Now with his experience and knowledge of combat, Aloysius steps into the arena as The Lion, and hopes to avenge his father by defeating Magnus Juventus in combat, along with becoming the best gladiator the world had ever known.</p>
