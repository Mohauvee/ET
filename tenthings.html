<h2>Ten Things</h2>
<h3>Here's A Few More Details I Learned About The Lion</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Aloysius is considered to be one of the greatest gladiators of all time by the commonfolk.</li>
	<li>After his first defeat, Aloysius trained vigorously with only one thought in mind: "Magnus Juventus."</li>
	<li>In his free time, Aloysius usually wanders around his town and stares at the larger-than-life castle that his rival lived in.</li>
	<li>One time, when walking around the streets late at night, Aloysius was attacked by bandits. After that, Aloysius was never attacked again.</li>
	<li>Aloysius had gained his title "The Lion" after pouncing on multiple different enemies, just as a lion would.</li>
	<li>Aloysius rarely takes his armor off; he says that it was custom designed to feel comfortable inside.</li>
	<li>In his time, gladiators would usually fight to the death, only ending when one is killed. But Aloysius was different; after knocking their weapon to the ground, Aloysius puts his sword to their neck and says, "Do you yield?" Usually the answer would be yes, because nobody wants to die.</li>
	<li>It is said that Aloysius could not be beaten at hand-to-hand combat or sword fighting.</li>
	<li>Many gladiators fought huge lions and tigers as a show of power, but Aloysius never fought one animal because he thought the only show of power he needed to display would be in the arena.</li>
	<li>Aloysius adopted a dog a year after his father died to keep him company.</li>
